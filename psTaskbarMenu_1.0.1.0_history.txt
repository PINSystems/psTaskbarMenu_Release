  - When a version update is identified and downloaded, a hash of the package 
    has been retrieved from GitHub. If the hash of the download file and the hash 
    from the version detail file don't match, the file is deemed corrupt and 
    the update is aborted.
  - All application files are hashed and those hashes are compared against 
    version detail data before installation.  
  - A "Validate" action has been added to the About UI.
    When this action is selected, app version detail information is downloaded 
    and all local application files are validated against the server supplied data. 

  NOTE: Version 1.0.0.14 and below will automatically update via PINSystesm.com
        until March, 15, 2024.  Following that date, updating psTaskbarMenu will
        require a manual process.  
        The manual process:
          1) Make sure psTaskbarMenu is closed.
          2) Rename the folder containing psTaskbarMenu.exe (making a backup)
          3) Create a new folder with the original name
          4) Download the latest psTaskbarMenu_<version>_app.zip from GitHub.
          5) Unzip that download into the original folder 
          6) After you're satisfied that it's running properly,delete the app zip file
             and the renamed psTaskbarMenu folder (the old version).
