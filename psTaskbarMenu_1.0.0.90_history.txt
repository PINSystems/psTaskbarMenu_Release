  - When a version update is identified and downloaded, a hash of the package 
    has been retrieved from GitHub. If the hash of the download and the hash 
    from the version detail file don't match, the file is deemed corrupt and 
    the update is aborted.
  - All application files are hashed and those hashes are compared against 
    version detail data before installation.  
  - A "Validate" action has been added to the About UI.
    When this action is selected, app version detail information is downloaded 
    and all application files are validated against the server data.

* Updated psiToast to be a self-contained control.
